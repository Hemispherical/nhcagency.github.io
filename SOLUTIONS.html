        <ul>
    <li> Education!!! Understand the differences in cultures, religions, beliefs and
    human behaviors Think of the peace, freedom and equality of all human
    beings, not just “one group of people” <li>
    <li>Education: education is a primary solution to terrorism. The government
    should educate the people to understand the differences in culture, religion,
    belief, and human behaviors.  <li>
    <li> Eliminate the root of terrorism: The way this world is attacking terrorism is
    funny. Every country is doing something to kill terrorism, but they still cannot
            eliminate all terrorist. </li>
    <li>Understand about terrorists: the solution is to find out the problem why a
    terrorist doesn't feel guilty and why he was forced to be a terrorist. It may be
        some injustice done to him. </li>

    One such way is eliminating the causes of terrorism
    <ul>
        <li>Relieve terrorist’s grievances </li>
    <li>Counterattacks.
    This is appealing because it appears that punishment and justice are achieved.
    Problems with counterattacks include easily identifying terrorists groups.
        When identified and attacked, such groups could respond with greater levels of terrorism.</li>
    <li> Imposing the rule of law through international cooperation.  Increased cooperation between
        states has led to an increase in extraditions and punishments. </li>
